So it's a lot, but I've included below a list of things to learn and do in the coming year. Some are for fun, some are things I've wanted to do but haven't had the time. Even though long-term goals and interests can change over time, I think it's still a helpful to come up with lists like this - it's a nice way to reflect on what direction you're going in and how you're growing as a person.

So here's what I may (or may not) be up to this year in no particular order:

* Contribute to open source projects
* Get better with functional programming 
    * Learn more about monads and category theory
    * Use partial application, closures, and other FP concepts in practical projects
* Learn about reactive programming 
    * Learn RxJS and related concepts
    * Use in an actual project
* Get in the habit of containerizing with Docker    
* Get in the habit of setting up CI/CD for any new projects
* Complete more personal projects
    * Finish making the hkpp-tracker for Anna Marie
    * Setup an OpenFaaS server 
    * Figure out the best way to do API authentication for small projects
    * Something using pandas & networkx?
* Learn another language
    * Rust?
    * Haskell?
* Write more 
    * Development-related?
    * Something unrelated to development for once?
